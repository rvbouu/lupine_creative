          <p className="p1">
          A few years ago I was hung up after a big shoulder surgery with nothing to do. I couldn't work so funds were tight but I still wanted to get my friends something for Christmas. I've always loved doing arts and crafts so I figured the "cheaper route" would be better.</p>
            <br></br>
          <p>cheap route....ha   ha    ha</p>
            <br></br>
          <p>If you've ever been to and arts and crafts store
          <li> The products are not cheap</li>
          <li> It's impossible to not buy a lot of stuff</li>
          <li> You always need more tools than you think. "Need" might not be the right word.</li>
          </p>
            <br></br>
          <p>I ended up getting all of the things I thought I would want for making polymer clay earrings, went home, and went to town. At this point polymer clay earrings were gaining popularity but weren't quite to the volume they are today. But I loved the idea and knew it would be worth the craft store expense. Light weight, customizable earrings? Sign me up!</p>
            <br></br>
          <p>I started by just wanting to make some for myself and for gifts. I shared a few photos on social media and completely unexpectently, got a bunch of comments and messages of people who wanted to BUY them! Whaaaaat?! So I started selling a few here and there and made a few custom pieces too. </p>
            <br></br>
          <p>After I realized how much I loved making them and that they could be a fun side hustle, I started to look for other opportunities. Somehow, those opportunies found me. So humbled. </p>
            <br></br>
          <p>Boise is such a speical community in this way and the entire summer I sold my earrings I was constanly suprised/grateful/in awe of peoples out reach and kindness. I hardly had to look for places to sell them and instead got asked to do First Thursdays and a friend helped connect me with someone to get me down at our local Saturday Market. Holy smokes! All of a sudden I'm selling at a couple events every week, doing a Wine Drinking and Clay Crafting event every month, I did a bachlorette party where the girls could make stuff...IT WAS SO FUN!!!</p>
            <br></br>
          <p>At the end of that summmer my wonderlust self got the best of me. I had made some extra money with Jypsea Lady Jewelry on top of my serving job, had gone through a break up, and wanted to leave the country. Sooooo I did. I spent a year between the Philippines, Mayalsia, Singapore, and New Zealand. </p>
            <br></br>
          <p>All of it came to a screeching hault when Covid came around and I made my way back to Idaho. Not wanting to go back into the restaurant industry, I decided to start a different company doing residential interior painting. What can I say, I'll do anything to create some art.</p>
            <br></br>
          <p>I got asked a lot if I would return to doing my earrings but there was something that always stood in my way, and as lame as it may sound, I hated the name of the company. I felt like it restriced me to just jewelry when I wanted to make other things too. I also felt like a little girl named it and the "jypsea" part didn't really feel right being in a land locked state and all. I spent the last couple years randomly writing down names that I could call the new company and since I love Lupines and they are and Idaho wild flower, I decided to go with Lupine Creative.</p>
            <br></br>
          <p>Fast forward a few years and I'm on my journey to MOTHERHOOD! HOLY CRAP! I decided I needed a stay at home job and somehow stumbled upon computer coding. I dont wtf I was thinking. It's so hard. BUT, it's also another form of art! For our last group project, my team wanted to do an e-commerce site. Sitting at my desk I look up and see earring making material. HMMMMM I just so happen to have left over inventory from my jewelry days and I would looooove to get back into it! </p>
            <br></br>
          <p>What a freaking blessing! These people working with me to make this site are God sends. They are the reason this site actually works and I am beyond grateful for not only choosing this as our final project, but its reignited a spark that I had wondered if I'd ever get back. </p>
            <br></br>
          <p>YAY!!! I hope you love these special creations as much as I do! I am thankful for every page visit and every purchase. Good vibes and love to my handmade crafts loving community! </p>
