# Lupine Creative

## Overview Description
Welcome to Lupine Creative!

Lupine Creative emerged from a stint of creativity during recovery from a shoulder surgery, blossoming from a desire to create affordable gifts. 

Initially I was crafting polymer clay earrings for personal enjoyment, the unexpected demand led to a flourishing side hustle. 

Now, Lupine Creative thrives as a platform for unique handmade creations, fueled by the support of a vibrant community.
